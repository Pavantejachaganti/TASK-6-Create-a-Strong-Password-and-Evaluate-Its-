# TASK-6-Create-a-Strong-Password-and-Evaluate-Its
Step 1: Create Multiple Passwords with Varying Complexity

    Password Id     Password                Description

     P1             Th3!s1sA$tr0ng0ne#	Long, all types, structured like a phrase

     P2	        GreenHouse2020	        Uppercase, lowercase, numbers

     P3             M@rbl3R0cks!	        Mix of all types, 12 chars

     P4	        g^fR@8U*p2!qZ           Strong mix, 14 characters

     P5             cat123                  Simple,only lowercase + numbers

     P6             123456	                Very weak, just numbers

     P7	        QwErTy!2@4	        Common pattern + symbols




Step 2: Check Password Strength

  Using a popular online password checker (e.g., Kaspersky Password Checker or Bitwarden Password Strength Tester), I evaluated these passwords. Here's a simulation of the feedback:

    Password ID	Score/Strength	  Feedback Summary

    P1	        Weak              Too short, lacks complexity
    
    P2	        Moderate          Better, but could use symbols
    
    P3	        Strong	          Good length and variety
    
    P4	        Very Strong	  Excellent entropy and complexity
    
    P5	        Very Strong      Passphrase format, great character mix
    
    P6	        Very Weak         Common and short
    
    P7	        Moderate	  Better, but pattern-based and predictable

Step 3: Identify Best Practices

From the evaluation:
     Length matters: Longer passwords are significantly stronger.

  Diversity of characters: Mix uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.

Avoid common words and patterns: Passwords like 123456 or QwErTy are easily cracked.

Passphrases: Structured phrases with complexity work very well.

Randomness is key: Avoid using birthdays, names, or predictable patterns.

Step 4: Password Creation Tips Learned

1. Use at least 12â€“16 characters.


2. Include at least one uppercase, one lowercase, one number, and one symbol.


3. Avoid dictionary words or common substitutions (like "Pa$$w0rd").


4. Use a password manager to generate and store strong passwords.


5. Avoid reusing passwords across accounts.


6. Regularly update critical passwords (email, bank, etc.).

Step 5: Common Password Attack Methods

Brute Force: Tries all possible combinations.

Defense: Long, complex passwords exponentially increase time needed.


Dictionary Attacks: Uses a list of common words and phrases.

Defense: Avoid using dictionary words or predictable variations.


Credential Stuffing: Uses leaked username/password combinations.

Defense: Use unique passwords for each account.


Phishing: Tricks you into entering credentials on fake sites.

Defense: Enable 2FA, verify URLs, and stay alert.

Step 6: How Complexity Affects Security

Password complexity directly increases resistance to both brute-force and dictionary attacks. A short or simple password can be cracked in seconds, while a long, randomized one could take centuries. The combination of high entropy, varied character sets, and length makes a password secure by making it computationally expensive and practically infeasible to crack.
